# replmower
supermower but good: a commandline curses game
# inactivity
inactive. see github.com/hideyosh1/newrotg or whatever it is
## changes with development
my main ideish software that i use is replit. recently that has been blocked, along with github. rn i will use gitlab but if necessary i will continue to update the github repo.
## how to install
clone the repo to the folder of your choice, create a folder called bin, then run make. if compiling with `make fastdebug` or `make clean` or `make release` you have to copy maps.json to the bin. do remember to run supermower.exe in the directory bin: that is, you `cd bin` and then do `./supermower.exe`.
## music
tbh i would enjoy having some music but i think gershwin and bartok (my favorites for game music) aren't public domain yet
## what even is this?
supermower is just a for fun game project inspired by old school character cell games and an earlier console game i made 
it's in beta rn

also i'd love it for people to gimme maps just like make an issue idc


some stuff:
performance is shaky especially for it being a console game like it doesn't "stutter" but like it doesn't run as smoothly and as fast as say gnu make does which is probably obvious but im probably going to make a better system in the future

also i might even rewrite the renderer or at least move the renderer to a separate .hpp

## stuff i might do
information's sparse on pads. i had to go to ibm's documentation and then linux.die.net information and then invisible island and then tldp.org until i finally found something. i recommend ibm's documentaiton on curses for this reason.
