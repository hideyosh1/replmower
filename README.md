# replmower
supermower but good: a commandline curses game
## what even is this?
supermower is just a for fun game project inspired by old school character cell games and an earlier console game i made 
it's in beta rn

also i'd love it for people to gimme maps just like make an issue idc


some stuff:
performance is shaky especially for it being a console game like it doesn't "stutter" but like it doesn't run as smoothly and as fast as say gnu make does which is probably obvious but im probably going to make a better system in the future

also i might even rewrite the renderer or at least move the renderer to a separate .hpp

## stuff i might do
information's sparse on pads. i had to go to ibm's documentation and then linux.die.net information and then invisible island and then tldp.org until i finally found something. i recommend ibm's documentaiton on curses for this reason.

## quality of life improvements
i feel like we need to be nicer to people with small screens. thus, i will implement a fullscreen minimap mode where you can see all tiles. it'll be really easy to implement.
