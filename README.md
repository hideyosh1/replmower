supermower but good: a commandline curses game
## what even is this?
supermower is just a for fun game project inspired by old school character cell games and an earlier console game i made 

also i'd love it for people to gimme maps just like make an issue idc
since i don't know anything bout software development the color for the main character is yellow because that's the closest color to human skin without being like purple

## about the engine

the engine's just about done, just need some testing to check it out and do some save file stuff. this works with (n/pd)curses. just need to do map generation/design but i'm tired.
