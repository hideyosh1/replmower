# replmower
supermower but good: a commandline curses game
## what even is this?
supermower is just a for fun game project inspired by old school character cell games and an earlier console game i made 
it's in beta rn

also i'd love it for people to gimme maps just like make an issue idc


some stuff:
performance is shaky especially for it being a console game like it doesn't "stutter" but like it doesn't run as smoothly and as fast as say gnu make does which is probably obvious but im probably going to make a better system in the future

also i might even rewrite the renderer or at least move the renderer to a separate .hpp

## stuff i might do
first of all i'l probably introduce pads so scaling isn't an issue anymore; also i might add whitespace inbetween tiles though that would make the cmd window requirement a little tougher though the standard windows command prompt is pretty big like 120x40 i think? replit's cmd prompt is a lot smaller.
